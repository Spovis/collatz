# collatz
This project visualizes the sequence generated by the Collatz conjecture using turtle graphics. If you want to use it to generate a screen saver or something like that, feel free to download it and play around with the resoution and anything else. 

The basic concept of these images is that each of the dendrites represents the path that a given number takes when used as a starting point for a collatz sequence. For more info about what a collatz sequnce is, see the veritasium video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg.

If you would like to run this code for yourself, you can download the main.py file and run it using python. 
I would recommend adjusting the values on line 42 to match the resolution of your monitor.
If you want to play around with the appearance of the graph, you can change the length value on line 83. A higher length will mean more individual dendrites. You can also adjust the value on line 73, a smaller value will give a smaller, more condensed graph. 

This might not be the most effecient way to do this but I used the tools I know and had a lot of fun making it.
Enjoy
