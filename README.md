# collatz
This project visualizes the sequence generated by the Collatz conjecture using turtle graphics. If you want to use it to generate a screen saver or something like that, feel free to download it and play around with the resoution and anything else. 

This might not be the most effecient way to do this but I used the tools I know and had a lot of fun making it.
Enjoy
